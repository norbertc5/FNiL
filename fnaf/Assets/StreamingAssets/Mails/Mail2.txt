Hello again!

How was your first night in work? Did you meet the "resisdents" of our labolatory?
I hope they didn't cause any trouble.

I have some information for you. Firstly, we have identified some problems with electric network in building. It can cause that your energy will be depleting faster. We'll fix this in short time, but for now close the doors only when it's nessecarry and save light.

Additionally, we conducted hormone theraphy on the "resisdents" today. They may be more active tonight. By the way, we should install better locks on the doors in isolations to prevent "resisdants" go outside. I must think about it. With better locks, your work shall be quiter.

And it's all. Good luck.
B.

P.S.
Tidy up the security room. There is such a big mess.
