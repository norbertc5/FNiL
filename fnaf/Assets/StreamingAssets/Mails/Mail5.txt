Hello,

It's your 5th night with us. It means that it's your last night in our company. Stay for moment after your shift. Somebody will come to give you your salary. I also need to remind you that the employment contract obligates you not to disclose anything you saw here to anyone. We really don't want you to break this contract.

B.
