Hello again!

Time is passing quickly, it's already the 3rd night!

I have good news for you. In short time (scientists say about a week) one of the "residents" will be ready for sell. We'll send him to anonymous buyer. It's the one with big muscles and weird face. Due to upcomming sale, he received a bigger dose of hormones, medicines and other substances (which can result in increased activity). If we can sell him quickly, your job will be easier.

Have you seen a small, brown creature who walks in vent channels? It's our newest "work of art," and we've named it "Clawler." Our scientists put a lot of work into making it able to walk on walls, so don't be surprised when you see it on the wall. Clawler likes to walk through the ventilation channels in the building. It may seem like a harmless animal, but it's not. If you see it in your room, it's necessary to look at it! Without eye contact, it may become aggressive. Just don't look away from it when it's in the security room.

Okay, that's all I wanted to tell you. Bye.
B.
