Hello, hello!

How are you? It's already your 4th night! Not everyone can handle it for so long.

I have to tell you something that I forgot earlier. The doors in the security room have some drawbacks. The "residents" are so strong that they can force the doors open. Luckly, the doors have a built-in alarm system. When somebody tries to open the door, the alarm will turn on. Maybe you have seen this before. When you hear loud beeping, that's door alarm. Quickly close the door before "resident" on the other side opens it. That creatures are more intelligent than it may seems.

Besides, I have to disappoint you. We won't able to send off that "resident" I mentioned to you yesterday before the end of your shift. You have to deal with him.

That's all for now.
B.
