Hello,

You probably didn't expect to come to this place again. Unfortunetly, we haven't been able to find anybody to replace you. You see that this work isn't very safe, so we don't want anybody to stay here too long. After 5 nights we always change night guard, but now we haven't found a replacement and somebody needs to maintain order here. Of course, we'll increase your salary for your additional effort.

B.
