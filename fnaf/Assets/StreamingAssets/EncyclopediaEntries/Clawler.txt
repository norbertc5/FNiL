Clawler is the newest creature from the Laboratory. In terms of size, he is similar to a dog.

One of Clawler's unique abilities is his ability to walk on walls and ceilings, which our scientists spent a lot of time achieving. He enjoys small spaces and is often found running through ventilation ducts.

His behaviour is depending on eye contact. It means that if somebody is looking at him, he won't beahave agressive. WITCHOUT EYE CONTACT, HE WILL BECAME AGRESSIVE.
