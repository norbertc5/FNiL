Skin-Man is another creature created by the laboratory. He is easy to recognize by his red skin, which is caustic upon contact with organic material, including human skin. Therefore, touching him without proper security measures can cause irritation. Like all the creatures from the laboratory, he was created on order.

According to the scientists, he has poor eyesight. Skin-Man is usually lethargic and slow, but can become aggressive at times.
