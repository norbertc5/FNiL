Ghoul is a tall, thin creature. You can recognize him by his green skin and big red eyes. Both of these characteristics appeared after a failed experiment.

Scientists say that Ghoul is very intelligent but sometimes moody. He has a well-developed self-awareness. If he's in good mood, he is able to cooperate with sciencics. Tests have also shown that light has an influence on his behaviour. When he spend time in well-lighted place, he seems to be happy. But without light he might be agressive. He's also very curious and when nobody looks at him, he like to rummage in cupboards and other places.
